title: Overview

In the Kubernetes Training a simple PostgreSQL StatefulSet has been developed. This training carries the PostgreSQL StatefulSet further and provides a deep dive into building a highly available, clustered PostgreSQL StatefulSet.

This training aims to provide a introduction to both *data service automation with Kubernetes* as well as *automating PostgreSQL*.

**The goal of the course is to learn about data service automation and not to produce a production automation solution**. Covering the entire lifecycle of a data service requires more effort than can be covered in a single training.

## Prerequisites

You should have processed the Kubernetes tutorial with special attention to the StatefulSet chapters.

## Namespace

The namespace for this training is `pg`.

Create the namespace and set it as a default as described in the [Kubernetes Tutorial](/kubernetes/10-basics/namespaces).
