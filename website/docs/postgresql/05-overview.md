In the Kubernetes Training a simple PostgreSQL StatefulSet has been developed. This training carries the PostgreSQL StatefulSet further and provides a deep dive into building a highly available, clustered PostgreSQL StatefulSet.

## Prerequisites

You should have processed the Kubernetes tutorial with special attention to the StatefulSet chapters.

## Namespace

The namespace for this training is `pg`.

* Create the namespace and set it as a default as described in the [Kubernetes Tutorial](/kubernetes/10-basics/namespaces).
