## Goal

The goal of this training is to enable you with the skills necessary to containerize your applications in order to run them in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Target Audience

This training has been created by anynines CEO Julian Fischer for the _Cloud Computing_ lecture held together with Prof. Esch at the Saarland University of Applied Sciences (HTWdS).

The training therefore targets at developers entering the world of containerization and Kubernetes. Every interested person who has mastered the basics of at least one programming language should be able to follow the training.

## Training Structure

The Kubernetes training has two major parts:

1. Containerization
2. Kubernetes

The first part _Containerization_ covers container basics such as containers, container images, container registries as well as how to build and publish simple container images.

The second part _Kubernetes_ then introduces the `kubectl` command followed by core Kubernetes concepts such as Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, ConfigMaps, Securities, Jobs, and StatefulSets. Practical examples show their basic usage. Additionally, a few common failure scenarios are included illustrating how these issues can be fixed.
