In order to learn to create containers we start with a local Docker installation.

## Installation
If you are on MacOS (or Windows), it is recommended to install 
[Docker Desktop[1]](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), since it is
the easiest to setup and will come with the Docker Desktop Dashboard to monitor
your running containers and images.

If you are on Linux, Docker Desktop is unfortunately (at least by the time of 
writing) still in closed beta, but it is also not necessary. It suffices to 
install the [Docker Engine [2]](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
(listed under 'Server').

> Note: This tutorial was not tested on Windows and it is also not recommended 
> to use it. The reason behind it is that when interacting with Cloud 
> Infrastructure, there is no way getting around Linux and we will also use 
> simple terminal commands and scripts throughout this tutorial. Therefore if 
> you have not done so already, give Linux a try, it's free !
